2. Extract the zip

3. Run `install_python.bat` if you don't have python installed

4. Open `main.py` with any text editor such as notepad

5. Replace `X` with your webhook where it says `hook = "X"` inside of the `main.py` file

6. Obfuscate your code: [https://pyobfuscate.com/](https://pyobfuscate.com/pyd) (Recommended)
